# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Lennart here.
## I am a Web Developer from Dortmund Germany, currently living in Lisbon Portugal. 
### Get in touch with me via https://lennartspee.com or my agencies website https://digitallokal.de or just stick to GitHub ðŸ˜„

âš¡ I am currently improving my ruby on rails and JS skills, while still tackeling own projects and project lead for my agency.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about surf spots in Portugal or which mistakes to avoid running a small business in Europe.
ðŸ¤” Before actually learning to code @LeWagon I used to build Wordpress Websites and Shopify shops - so GitHub was not my first place to search for solutions - but I am happy to increase my usage of this awesome plattform! ðŸ‘¯
